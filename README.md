# esp-idf-wifi-apsta
Example to WIFI_MODE_APSTA with esp-idf.

esp-idf contains examples in station mode (WIFI_MODE_STA) and softap mode (WIFI_MODE_AP), but there are no examples in apsta mode (WIFI_MODE_APSTA).

I referred [here](https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=10619).

The ESP32 chip has the following four MAC addresses:   
- MAC for WiFi STA mode
- MAC for WiFi AP mode
- MAC for Bluetooth Classic
- Mac for Ethernet

The ESP32-S2 chip has the following two MAC addresses:   
- MAC for WiFi STA mode
- MAC for WiFi AP mode

The ESP32-S3 chip has the following three MAC addresses:   
- MAC for WiFi STA mode
- MAC for WiFi AP mode
- MAC for Bluetooth LE

The ESP32-C3 chip has the following three MAC addresses:   
- MAC for WiFi STA mode
- MAC for WiFi AP mode
- MAC for Bluetooth LE

Since there are separate STA mode MACs and AP mode MACs, APSTA mode works as both AP and STATION.

# Software requirements
esp-idf v4.4/v5.0.   
This is because this version supports ESP32-C3.   

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-wifi-apsta
cd esp-idf-wifi-apsta
idf.py set-target {esp32/esp32s2/esp32s3/esp32c3}
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py flash monitor
```
